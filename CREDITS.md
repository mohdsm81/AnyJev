# Credits

AnyJev stands on other people's work. Attribution lives here, not in identifiers.

## Projects we build on

- **TypeSafe AI, Jev**: the product that defined the interface (state, typed questions, calibrated answers in one pass). Not affiliated.
- **Qwen** (Apache-2.0): the base models of the Tacit checkpoints, Qwen3-1.7B, Qwen3-4B, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3.5-2B and Qwen3.5-9B.
- **vLLM** (Apache-2.0): the inference engine behind `Tacit(engine="vllm")`, `engine="server"` and `VLLMBackend`.
- **JevBench** (fstandhartinger/jevbench, MIT) and **bev-decision** (avbiswas/bev-decision): the two benchmarks the Tacit results are reported on.
- The open readout clones that documented the problem first: SemIf, LitJev, the OpenJev servers, poorjev, open-llm-classifier. Their READMEs said the probabilities were not calibrated and the order mattered; this repo measures it.

## Reported and contributed

People outside the project whose reports and patches changed the code. Issue numbers are in the
CHANGELOG next to what they fixed.

- **[@efronh](https://github.com/efronh)** — found that L2 was broken on transformers 5 and
  identified the renamed `create_causal_mask` argument in the report (#4).
- **[@lws2004](https://github.com/lws2004)** — found that the `hf` extra could not build a backend
  at all, traced it to `device_map` and the undeclared `accelerate`, and supplied the change that
  fixes that, the Apple Silicon segfault and the `.model` assumption together (#5).
- **[@shentonyan](https://github.com/shentonyan)** — wrote the SGLang backend (`anyjev/backends/sglang.py`)
  with its parity script and contract tests, and reworked it onto SGLang's real response shape (#12).
- **[@tak-bro](https://github.com/tak-bro)** — found that `VLLMBackend` silently read a label missing from
  the server's top log-probabilities as -30, and traced it to vLLM's raw log-probability mode (#13).
- **[@Tusm11](https://github.com/Tusm11)** — wrote the llama.cpp backend (`anyjev/backends/llamacpp.py`) with its
  parity script, parity runs and stub-engine tests, and carried it through two rounds of review (#1, #2).
- **[@monke-sniper](https://github.com/monke-sniper)** — reproduced the llama.cpp backend independently on Windows
  and found that the prebuilt CUDA wheel traps on CPUs without AVX-512 (#2).
