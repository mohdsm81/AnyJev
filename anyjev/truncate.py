"""Write a model with its last blocks removed, so every runtime can serve a truncated forward.

A decision often does not need the whole model: the last blocks mostly convert an answer the
model has already formed into token space. Skipping them is the one efficiency lever that is
linear in cost -- but only the local `transformers` path can stop a forward early, and an
inference server cannot be asked to run "most of" a model.

So do it on disk instead. `truncate(model, blocks, out)` writes a normal checkpoint that simply
has fewer layers: `config.json` with `num_hidden_layers = blocks`, the tensors of those blocks,
the embeddings, the final norm and the head. Nothing downstream has to know. vLLM serves it,
`transformers` loads it, a quantiser quantises it, llama.cpp converts it -- because it is not a
special object, it is a smaller model.

    python -m anyjev.truncate Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct 18 /models/qwen2.5-7b-b18

**Read the state of the model you serve.** A truncated model applies its final norm after the
last block it kept, so its output vector is `norm(h_b)`, while `HFBackend` captures `h_b` itself
at an intermediate block. Those are different spaces, and anything fitted on one of them (a map
into the final basis, a probe) silently reads the wrong one if moved to the other. Fit against
whichever artifact you will deploy.
